I recently had a few deep conversations about Twitter. Because of what I do for a living, many have shared a range of feelings with me in regards to the platform and people tend to default to saying something is ‘no good’ or ‘pointless’ if they don’t understand it. And with Twitter in particular, I can see how a platform of such scale can be intimidating.

First, I acknowledge the overwhelming factor, but I counter it by providing a different vantage point: a way to simplify how they consume content.

This is why I suggest a way to ease yourself in and start to understand the platform by taking the listen-first approach. That takes away the “fear” that most people who aren’t familiar with the platform have: what on earth would I share? I assure them, though Twitter would encourage the opposite, that they shouldn’t feel the pressure to share, it’s not a necessity.

Here’s a guide to help someone as they begin their Twitter journey.

## 1. Sign Up for Twitter
Go ahead and create your account. If you already have other social media accounts attached to your business, try to secure the same username for consistency across all your social media accounts. Plus, it is good to lock it up before someone else grabs it from you.

## 2. Follow Your Competitors
Following your competition will start sending their tweets directly into your feed. This is a great way to start "listening" to the messages they are publishing. What are they doing well? How are they interacting with people? What complaints are they getting or problems are they solving? All of these are opportunities to learn what is happening in your industry and how your competitors are interacting with their customers, in real-time. And **yes** they will see that you started following them and **no**, it doesn't matter.

## 3. Start "Listening" to Conversations
Be picky about who you follow. In this early stage, we are focusing only on consuming competitive content. If you end up following too many accounts you lose the value of Twitter as a "listening" platform and will have to start organizing who you follow into lists (future blog post maybe?).

## 4. Understand Hashtags
There are two main purposes of hashtags. The most important is to aggregate, control and participate in a conversation. More times than not this tends to have a real-time factor. The other, which many people abuse, is to make a point. Those are the over exaggerated, long, frivolous, multitude of hashtags you see.

## 5. Interact With Others
You don’t have to proactively mass-post if you’re still unsure of what you want to say. Respond (always start with @________) to the posts you see on your news feed – whether it’s a simple tip of the cap in agreement or maybe a contrary opinion or additional comment you’d like to share via an accessible virtual conversation. Baby steps.

## 6. Join the Conversation, But Only if You’re Ready
Evaluate whether you want to share with others – it’s not for everyone. By now you will most likely have some sort of a following, whether it’s friends or strangers that stumbled upon your account, so figure out what out what you’d like your presence to be. But try not to just share for the sake of sharing. I’ve personally broken down what type of content my tweets fall under, percentage-wise, similar to content pillars for a brand, and for the most part I color within those lines.
